    "        \"\"\"\"I go to the kitchen and there's no fish, nothing,\" he says. \"What are we supposed to eat?\" George harvested his cocoa in October but still hasn't been paid for it.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"I delivered 1.8 tonnes of cocoa, but up until this day I haven't received any money,\" he says, reaching into his pocket to pull out the receipt as proof.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"If there's no money, what can I do?\" he asks.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"The money from cocoa supports the farm, the family and it sends my children to school.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Ivory Coast is facing an unprecedented cocoa crisis and it is all down to the price.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"The international price has fallen sharply since the end of 2015, in part due to abundant supply and weak demand.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Parts of the world like China and India haven't caught up with Europe and North America in their love of chocolate as quickly as was expected.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"The price is down 40% from July last year. That coupled with the fact that the Ivorian government raised the price that farmers get has meant cocoa buyers, who buy their stock a year in advance, suddenly faced massive losses if they honored their contracts.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Up to 80% of buyers have backed out of their contracts, leaving farmers like George penniless.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Twenty kilometers from his village along the coast in San Pedro, the problem is suddenly very evident.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"This is the world's biggest cocoa port, and the traffic is usually unbearable; huge articulated lorries pounding the potholed roads, street vendors peddling goods and food on every corner. But today it's quiet.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"The factories are closed. Trucks full of cocoa are backed up along the roads quickly clogging up the streets. The city has almost ground to a halt.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Outside one factory I counted nearly 150 lorries packed full with cocoa parked up on the side of the roads. More are coming every day.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"I've been here for a month and 15 days,\" says one truck driver, who has rigged up a hammock underneath the trailer as a makeshift bed. \"We have to sleep with the truck because of the thieves.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"We keep being told there isn't any place to unload the cocoa, just be patient and wait.\" He shares a cup of tea with one of the other drivers. Even in the early morning, the heat and humidity are oppressive.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"At the Catholic Church in the heart of the city, 20 presidents of cocoa farmers' cooperatives from around the region meet. Between them, they represent almost 20,000 farmers. And they're angry that they can't pay their children's school fees, feed their families, and prepare for the next harvest.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"It's estimated about six million people are dependent on the earnings from cocoa in Ivory Coast - more than a quarter of the entire population.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"It's the backbone of the economy, amounting to a quarter of total exports and around 15% of state revenues.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"If the industry is paralyzed, it affects everyone. And as the world's largest exporter of cocoa, the effects on the chocolate industry itself are already being felt.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"If the crisis remains, there will be a great impact on the prices,\" says Ivorian economist Yousef Carios. \"That could have an impact on the final industry which is chocolate and also the cocoa on the financial market could be impacted too.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Ivory Coast's Coffee-Cocoa Council has a special cocoa stabilization fund stored in Ivorian bank accounts designed to smooth out price problems like this, as well as a reserve fund at the Central Bank of West African States.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Neither, however, has been touched. Farmers claim that means they're empty.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"The Council insists they're not and has ordered an audit to prove it. Director-general Massandje Toure-Litse says they are trying to sort out the situation.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"We are working with the port authorities to do everything we can to return things quickly back to normal,\" she asserts, claiming that these measures will help the situation more quickly than dipping into the funds.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"We know that things are being done to sort this out. We are working hard to set things right,\" she repeats, insisting that this isn't a crisis, the cocoa isn't 'blocked,' and that things are just simply taking a bit longer than usual.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Back in Petit Nado, George's village, we walk to the plantation. It should be bustling with workers at this time of the year, preparing for the next season, but it's completely empty.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"\"We're scared for the next harvest because up until now we don't have the money to pay for fertiliser,\" he says.\"\"\",\n",

    "        \"\"\"Tradin Organic reaffirms commitment to Sierre Leone sustainable cocoa production\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"With major EU deforestation and wider industry standards legislation being tabled this summer, Tradin Organic cocoa business has reaffirmed its commitments to sustainable cocoa production in Sierre leone, setting a high bar for ethical frameworks, writes Neill Barston.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"As the Netherlands-based company noted, it has taken a strong approach to delivering digital traceability and due diligence frameworks, with its supplies and products being fully traced back to the cooperatives, farmers, and fields they originate from.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"This transparency allows customers to access comprehensive information about the origin and production methods of the cocoa they purchase. Digitalisation is key to making this process faster and more efficient, and to include more impact data. Tradin Organic works closely together with Smallholdr, a savvy software tool that enables complete traceability up to field level.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"According to the firm, the mobile app and web-based platform help manage certification requirements, produce deforestation-free claims and measure impact of technical assistance projects like Tradin Sierra Leone’s Child Protection and Agroforestry projects. Chocolate manufacturers, brands and retailers will have access to all data and information requirements in upcoming regulation, and Tradin Organic will continue to work with its most engaged clients to bring the stories of the farmers to consumers.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Pioneering Regenerative Organic Cocoa in Sierra Leone Tradin Organic has been at the forefront of implementing Regenerative Organic Cocoa (ROC) in Sierra Leone, showcasing its dedication to sustainable farming practices. Since 2015, our team has been working with local smallholder farmers producing organic cocoa. In 2021, Tradin Organic’s cocoa achieved the important milestone in becoming ROC-certified, being one of the first worldwide. Tradin Organic runs an extensive agroforestry program together with the agronomists of Ecotop.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"This partnership endeavours to protect endangered species while empowering local farmers. By adopting a smart regenerative agroforestry system, cocoa farmers can enhance their yields, discourage deforestation, and bolster their livelihoods. This way they empower farmers to increase cocoa production without resorting to clearing forests for new plots.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Pre-agreed contracts with cooperatives Tradin Organic has already secured pre-agreed contracts with nine cooperatives for the upcoming cocoa season in Sierra Leone. In some cases, these cooperatives were reinstated by Tradin Organic after their initial establishment and disbandment before 2015. This approach is particularly meaningful in countries like Sierra Leone, which are still recovering from the devastating impacts of factors such as Ebola and war.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"Through these collaborations, Tradin Organic contributes to the economic revitalisation of communities and provides stability and security to farmers. Lowest Cadmium levels worldwide By sourcing from Sierra Leone, Tradin Organic can offer product with the lowest cadmium levels among all cocoa origins. By meticulously managing cadmium content, Tradin Organic ensures that its cocoa and cocoa blends remain well below regulatory limits, which tremendously helps chocolate makers cope with the strict European regulation on cadmium in cocoa and derived products. This diligent quality control not only ensures compliance with safety standards but also guarantees exceptional taste and purity in its products. Certifications Tradin Organic’s commitment to sustainability is reinforced by its certifications from respected organisations such as Fairtrade, Naturland and Rainforest Alliance amongst others.\"\"\",\n",
    "        \"\"\"These certifications validate the company’s adherence to strict environmental and social standards across its supply chain. By upholding these certifications, Tradin Organic assures consumers of its responsible practices, supports the preservation of natural habitats, and ensures the well-being of farmers and communities involved in cocoa production. Partnering for a shared sustainable future Additionally, Sierra Leone’s unique advantage as a chemical fertiliser-free region guarantees the organic integrity of the cocoa, a quality that is very much appreciated by their customers.\"\"\"\n",
